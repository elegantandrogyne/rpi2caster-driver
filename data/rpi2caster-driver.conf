# [XYZ]
# Per-interface settings.
#
# Define as many interface sections as you like;
# typically up to 4 interfaces are supported per Raspberry Pi
# (each one of them uses two MCP23017 chips, and there can be max 8 of them
# on a single I2C bus).
#
# Each interface will be available on a separate URL:
# http://[host:port]/interfaces/[lowercase_section_name],
#
# sensor_gpio: GPIO pin for machine cycle sensor
# i2c_bus: I2C bus number
# mcp0: 1st MCP23017 address
# mcp1: 2nd MCP23017 address
# valve1, valve2, valve3, valve4: signals assignments to valves
#     this decides which valve controller gets what signals
#     valve1: mcp0 port A, valve2: mcp0 port B, valve3: mcp1 port A, valve4: mcp1 port B
# supported_modes: operation modes supported by this interface
#     (0: testing, 1: casting, 2: punching, 3: manual_punching)
#     limiting this to casting or punching only will disable the other mode from being used
# supported_row16_modes: row 16 addressing modes supported by this interface and caster
#     (0: off, 1: HMN, 2: KMN, 3: unit-shift)
#     the software will adjust the incoming signal combination based on this mode
#     this does not affect the testing or punching mode, where all modes are available
# casting_startup_timeout: time (per cycle) before machine stop exception occurs
#     when starting to cast and checking if the machine is turning
# casting_sensor_timeout: time (for sensor ON and OFF) before the driver
#     raises a machine stop exception during casting
# casting_pump_stop_timeout: time (for sensor ON and OFF) to wait when attempting
#     to stop the pump (slower, as the operator often turns the machine by hand then)
# punching_on_time: how long to keep the air flowing during punching,
# punching_off_time: how long to wait for the punches to fall and ribbon to advance
